NOTE
====
This is an evolving code base.  I'm constantly tinkering with it.  That said,
now that I'm releasing this to the world, I'm being somewhat more responsible
about locking down stable release points.  In between releases, however, I'll
be messing with things. **It's very possible
I could break something while doing this, so check back for status updates
if you download the code in between releases**.  I've finally become a little
more modern and started adding
automated testing, so as time goes by hopefully the "in between" releases will
be somewhat more reliable.  Check back often for exciting new features and bug
fixes!
